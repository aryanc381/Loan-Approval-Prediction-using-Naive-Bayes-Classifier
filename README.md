This project aims to predict the loan eligibility of individuals using a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). The model is built and evaluated using va1rious features of the dataset to determine the eligibility of loan applicants.

## Project Overview

Loan approval prediction is a critical task in the financial sector. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can automate and enhance the decision-making process, reducing manual errors and increasing efficiency. This project utilizes the Naive Bayes Classifier, a simple yet effective probabilistic classifier, to predict whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan.

## Features

- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection:** Selecting relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction model.
- **Model Building:** Implementing the Naive Bayes Classifier to predict loan eligibility.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features of loan applicants, including:

- Applicant's income
- Co-applicant's income
- Loan amount
- Loan term
- Credit history
- Property area
- Gender
- Marital status
- Education
- Employment status

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LoanApprovalPrediction
cd LoanApprovalPrediction
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, build and evaluate the Naive Bayes model.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, providing insights into its accuracy and reliability in predicting loan eligibility. Detailed results and visualizations are included in the Jupyter Notebook. The accuracy of model on test data was ```81.02%```.
